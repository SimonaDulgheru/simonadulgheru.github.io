                        I am an experienced Midwife with excellent technical and communication skills looking to transition into a career as Full Stack Developer.
                        Ambitious and persistent, I have changed different health systems, guidelines and legal liabilities while earning numerous appraisals and very good patient reviews. I am now excited about attending University of Birmingham Coding Boot Camp.

                        <br>
                        At Bootcamp, I love learning new things and try to implement in a personalized way that allows me to be creative. I am usually industrious and try to solve the bugs while I develop new ways of thinking and strive for a clean code. I gravitate towards JavaScript/Java as it is more complex and challenging. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        AFor the future, I hope to be part of a dynamic team as Back End Developer and use my technical and personal skills to develop interesting tools and applications. I want to take part in making the world a better place through technology and smart thinking.
